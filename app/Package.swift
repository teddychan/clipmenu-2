// ClipMenu — modern rewrite (scaffold).
// Built as a SwiftPM executable so it compiles with the Command Line Tools
// toolchain (no full Xcode required). Agent / menu-bar behavior is established
// at runtime via NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.accessory); the bundled .app uses
// the LSUIElement Info.plist at app/Info.plist (SwiftPM forbids Info.plist as
// a target resource, so it lives outside Sources and is applied when the .app
// bundle / Xcode project is produced later).
//
// DragonKit is the shared foundation of every Dragon menu-bar app (settings
// shell, About / What's New / Permissions / Uninstall panes, localization).
// Depended on at a version tag — never vendored. Its Sparkle-backed updates
// live in a separate product, DragonKitUpdates, linked ONLY for the direct /
// Developer ID build: the Mac App Store build must not contain a self-updater
// (App Store policy + sandbox), so with CLIPMENU_SPARKLE unset nothing links
// Sparkle and the MAS / test builds stay Sparkle-free. The `SPARKLE` compile
// flag gates the app's update UI (scripts/run.sh and
// .github/workflows/release.yml set CLIPMENU_SPARKLE=1; the MAS workflow does
// not).
